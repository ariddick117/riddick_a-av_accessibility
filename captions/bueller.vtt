What is so dangerous about a character like Ferris Bueller

00:15:10 --> 00:19:00 align:middle line:90%
is he gives good kids, bad ideas

00:20:10 --> 00:23:30 align:middle line:90%
Why should he get to skip school when everybody else has to go?

00:24:10 --> 00:26:00 align:middle line:90%
- Syphilitic meningitis?
- He never gets caught!

00:26:10 --> 00:29:00 align:middle line:90%
This guy in my biology class, he said that if Ferris dies,

00:29:10 --> 00:32:00 align:middle line:90%
he's giving his eyes to Stevie Wonder.

00:32:10 --> 00:34:00 align:middle line:90%

00:40:10 --> 00:42:00 align:middle line:90%
They think he's a righteous dude.

00:42:10 --> 00:44:00 align:middle line:90%
Think you'll be alive this weekend?

00:44:10 --> 00:47:00 align:middle line:90%
I can see him denying popular belief, setting off on some impossible mission

00:47:10 --> 00:51:30 align:middle line:90%
He jeopardizes my ability to effectively govern this student body.

00:52:00 --> 00:55:00 align:middle line:90%
- He does whatever he wants...
- You know, as long as I've known him, everything works for him.

00:55:10 --> 00:57:00 align:middle line:90%
Whenever he wants, he's very cool

00:57:10 --> 01:00:00 align:middle line:90%
And he never gets nailed

01:00:10 --> 01:01:00 align:middle line:90%
Ferris can do anything

01:01:10 --> 01:02:30 align:middle line:90%
Ah, he's such a sweetie!

01:02:40 --> 01:07:00 align:middle line:90%
Wake up and smell the coffee Ms. Bueller. It's a fool's paradise

01:07:10 --> 01:10:30 align:middle line:90%
He is just leading you down the primrose path!

01:10:40 --> 01:14:30 align:middle line:90%
